# Pollution level forecasting with multivariate time series 

* ___[Skills Demonstrated]___: _Sequential Data, Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory Model, Pandas, PyTorch, scikit-learn_

I utilize a dataset consisting of the measured air pollution in Beijing (time series dataset) with other (dependable) air characteristics (e.g., temperature and pressure) to conduct a ___multivariate time series analysis___, with the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, to forecast future air pollution levels. 

The dataset is roughly a decade old, so it is quite outdated for actually meaningful forcasting for today's applicability, but the methods applied here for the time-series analysis are still worthwhile to explore and present.

* For the theory, I reviewed the second lecture from this course: http://introtodeeplearning.com/
* For a more comprehensable/bitesize approach, I found the discussion here immensly helpful: https://cnvrg.io/pytorch-lstm/
