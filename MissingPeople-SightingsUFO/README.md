### Description

___[Data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data)___

I utilize a dataset consisting of the measured air pollution in Beijing (time series dataset) with other (dependable) air characteristics (e.g., temperature and pressure) to conduct a ___multivariate time series analysis___, with the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, to forecast future air pollution levels. 

The dataset is roughly a decade old, so it is quite outdated for actually meaningful forcasting for today's applicability, but the methods applied here for the time-series analysis are still worthwhile to explore and present.
